## Executable Petri-net models
To verify the correctness of the PN-to-BP translation, we wrote all Petri-net models using the [SNAKES](https://snakes.ibisc.univ-evry.fr) package. More details on these models are in the [pn](pn) folder.

## Executable BP models
All BP models, including the translated-to-BP models, are in the [pn](pn) folder. The models can be executed and analyzed.
